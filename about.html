        <h1>A Comparison between Salon de 1863 and Salon des Refusés</h1>
        <p class = "dropcap">Art historians generally agree that Salon des Refusés was the most decisive institutional development in the progress of modern art.  The roaring discontent of the rejected artists resulted in the questioning of the jury decision and the criteria for public exhibition: Does entrance into the official salon guarantee the quality of the artworks? Could the jury’s refusal be equated to critical denunciation ? Exhibiting Salon de 1863 and Salon des Refusés side by side offered contemporaneous visitors a point of comparison. My goal is to examine press and public criticisms to analyze whether one was deemed superior to the other. Specifically, I will use reviews of the artworks published in newspapers during the exhibitions as the primary sources. </p>

        <p class = "dropcap">I constructed a relational database using SQLite and created seven tables: Artists, Artworks, Critics, Exhibition, Review, ReviewandArtists, and Review Quality. Using SQL to join all the tables together, I created a database that identifies which critics wrote which reviews evaluating the artworks by the artists exhibited at specific exhibitions as well as how positive the review quality was.  Due to the limited number of resources, I only selected 10 articles that reviewed 41 artists and 50 of their artworks. For instance, one review could address five artists and their works exhibited as either of the exhibitions; a review could contain either the critic’s opinion or that of the public. </p>
        
        <p class = "dropcap">Another important step of this project was to quantify the reviews. I classified the reviews as “positive,” “negative,” or “mixed,” with each corresponding to a primary key in the Review Quality table. After collecting and organizing all the data, I assigned a numerical value to each review: positive as 1, negative as 0, and mixed as 0.5. Using SQL, I calculated the average score received by each exhibition according to the review quality for each artist.  The result indicated that Salon de 1863 received a score of 0.839 compared to 0.62 for Salon des Refusés. Thus, according to the 10 reviews analyzed, Salon de 1863 was more critically acclaimed than Salon des Refusés. Although the reviews for the official salon were closer to positive, the reviews for the counter-salon were closer to mixed. </p>
